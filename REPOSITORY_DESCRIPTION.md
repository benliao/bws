# BWS Repository Description

## Short Description (For GitHub)
A memory-safe, high-performance web server and reverse proxy built with Rust. Features automatic SSL/TLS management, multi-site hosting, and intelligent load balancing.

## Long Description

**BWS (Ben's Web Server)** is a production-ready web server and reverse proxy that prioritizes memory safety and performance. Built on Cloudflare's Pingora framework with Rust's ownership model, BWS eliminates entire classes of security vulnerabilities while delivering enterprise-grade performance.

### Key Strengths

**üõ°Ô∏è Memory Safety**: Rust's type system prevents buffer overflows, use-after-free vulnerabilities, and data races at compile time. No runtime memory errors in production.

**‚ö° Performance**: Built on Pingora (handles 20% of internet traffic), featuring zero-copy operations, async-first architecture, and native compilation with aggressive optimizations.

**üîí SSL Excellence**: Automatic Let's Encrypt integration with zero-downtime certificate renewal. Perfect Forward Secrecy and modern TLS configurations out of the box.

**üåê Advanced Features**: Multi-site hosting, intelligent load balancing (round-robin, weighted, least-connections), WebSocket proxying, and hot configuration reloading.

**üîß Operations Ready**: Comprehensive monitoring, Docker support, cross-platform binaries, and clear error handling for production environments.

### Use Cases
- **High-traffic websites** requiring guaranteed memory safety
- **Microservice architectures** needing reliable load balancing
- **SSL-heavy deployments** with automatic certificate management
- **Development environments** with multi-site hosting needs
- **Security-conscious organizations** prioritizing memory safety

### Technical Foundation
- **Language**: Rust (memory safety, zero-cost abstractions)
- **Framework**: Pingora (Cloudflare's production proxy)
- **Architecture**: Async-first, non-blocking I/O
- **Security**: Compile-time memory safety guarantees
- **Performance**: Zero-copy operations, native compilation

BWS represents the next generation of web infrastructure: combining the performance of systems languages with the safety guarantees that modern applications demand.
